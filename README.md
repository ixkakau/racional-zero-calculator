# racional-zero-calculator

Allows to find all rational roots of a polynomial expresion of degree 2 or higher by inputing only coeficients and avoiding entire input of terms. Saves time but it also gives output for all possible combinations (p/q) that could be the rational roots of the polynomial. Handy if different polynomials with high degrees need to be analyzed.

Language: python.
